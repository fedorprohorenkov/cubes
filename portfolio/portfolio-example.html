        <p class="paragraph-lead">Data is more tractable than program logic. It follows that where you see a choice between complexity in data structures and complexity in code, choose the former. More: in evolving a design, you should actively seek ways to shift complexity from code to data.</p>

        <p>The Unix community did not originate this insight, but a lot of Unix code displays its influence. The C language's facility at <em>manipulating pointers</em>, in particular, has encouraged the use of dynamically-modified reference structures at all levels of coding from the kernel upward. Simple pointer chases in such structures frequently do duties that implementations in other languages would instead have to embody in more <em>elaborate</em> procedures.</p>

        <p>One of Unix's oldest and most <em>persistent design rules</em> is that when a program has nothing interesting or surprising to say, it should shut up. Well-behaved Unix programs do their jobs unobtrusively, with a minimum of fuss and bother. Silence is golden.</p>

        <p>The easiest programs to use are those that demand the least new learning from the user — or, to put it another way, the easiest programs to use are those that most effectively connect to the user's pre-existing knowledge.</p>

        <h4 class="text-title">Many browserlike and editorlike programs under Unix obey this pattern.</h4>
        <p>Therefore, avoid gratuitous novelty and excessive cleverness in interface design. If you're writing a calculator program, ‘+’ should always mean addition! When designing an interface, model it on the interfaces of functionally similar or analogous programs with which your users are likely to be familiar.</p>

        <p>Pay attention to your <em>expected audience</em>. They may be end users, they may be other programmers, or they may be system administrators. What is least surprising can differ among these groups. Well-designed programs treat the user's attention and concentration as a precious and limited resource, only to be claimed when necessary.</p>
